# 3D pose estimation

## The way of estimation I 
- regression
- GAN
- Vnect

## Dataset
Now I only use h36m as a datasets and have to use mpii_inf_3dhp.


### Regression
This is the simplest way of estimation something.
it have already implemented.
but showing result is too bad.
the camera calibration and so on are tiresome.


### GAN 
This is my idea of estimation bone position.
perhaps bone position is generated by distribution in 3d space


### Vnect 
Vnect is one of the famous way to estimate pose.
See the detail on it.
